<h2>Research Participation</h2>
<p>Research participation is a required course component at Level C and Level M.</p>
	      <h3>Level C</h3>
		  <p>At Level C you are required to collect 25 course credits by actively participating in psychological research.  All research will have been approved by the Ethics Committee prior to being advertised on SONA and risk will have been assessed and mitigated for. Each credit is worth 15 minutes of your time, which equates to around six and a half hours particpation over your first academic year.  Some studies will be 1 or 2 credits, and some will be worth a lot more as they will require much longer participation durations, or participating over a number of days/weeks</p>
	      <h3>Why?</h3>
	      <p>Participating in research allows you to understand what it is like to be a participant and what kind of information you should receive in order that you feel that you can participate with informed consent. It will also give you some ideas about directions in psychology that you find interesting, see how studies are run in a professional manner and debriefed with full information at the end of the study. All of this may help you find an area of interest, develop your own professional practice, and appreciate the complexities of informed consent as a participant</p>
