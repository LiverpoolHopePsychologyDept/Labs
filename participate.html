			<h2>Why do we have a Participant Pool?</h2>
				<p>Many areas of research in the Psychology Department rely on collecting data from human participants. Often these experiments are computer-based, and are run in labs based in the Hope Park Campus. We also run experiments online, and use questionnaires to gather data.</p>
				<p>The Participant Pool plays a key role in the Department of Psychology's educational and research strategy. Its objectives can be summarised in three ways:
					<ol>
						<li>Enrich the educational experience for undergraduate students by providing opportunities to engage in the research process</li>
						<li>Improve public understanding and support for psychological research</li>
						<li>Support the research goals of the Department of Psychology</li></ol>
				</p>  
<hr>
			<h2>Educational value of research participation</h2>
				<p>In today's competitive job market, possessing strong research skills distinguishes university graduates. By actively participating in research, students acquire knowledge, comprehension, and values that form the foundation of these skills. This experience aims to contribute to fulfilling the undergraduate learning outcomes of the psychology program, encompassing a broad and in-depth understanding of the discipline and proficiency in research methods.</p>

				<h3>Earning course credits</h3>
					<p>At Level C and I undergraduate students are required to collect 25 course credits by actively participating in psychological research.  All research is scrutinised by the Ethics Committee prior to being advertised on the Department of Psychology participant pool. Risk will have been assessed and mitigated for. Each credit is worth 15 minutes of your time, which equates to around six and a half hours particpation over each academic year.  Some studies will be 1 or 2 credits, and some will be worth a lot more as they will require much longer participation durations, or participating over a number of days/weeks</p>
					<p>Your contact for any enquiries from students in Level C is Dr Jamie Lingwood (lingwoj@hope.ac.uk)</p>
				<h3>Accessing available studies</h3>
					<p>The Participant Pool can be accessed via <a href="https://liverpoolhope.sona-systems.com/">https://liverpoolhope.sona-systems.com/</a> Alternatively, you can find it through the mobile app - simply search 'sona mobile' in the App store or Google Play Store.</p>
					<p>You will be asked for a URL, which is the same as the above, and will be emailed your password so that you can log in by using your University username when you sign up.</p>
					<p>If you fail to turn up to a study without informing the researcher, you will incur a penalty equal to the number of credits of the study. If the study is worth 3 credits for example, you will lose 3 credits. It is important that you turn up to studies or cancel 24 hours in advance.
					<p>Students with 5 no shows will be contacted by their tutor.</p>
