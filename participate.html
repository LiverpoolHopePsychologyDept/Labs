			<h1>Take Part in Psychology Research</h1>

			<h2>Why do we have a Participant Panel?</h2>
				<p>Many areas of research in the School of Psychology rely on collecting data from human participants. Often these experiments are computer-based, and are run in labs based in the Hope Park Campus. We also run experiments online, use questionnaires, focus groups or interviews to gather data.</p>
				<p>The Participant Panel plays a key role in the School of Psychology's educational and research strategy. Its objectives can be summarised in three ways:
					<ol>
						<li>Enrich the educational experience for undergraduate students by providing opportunities to engage in the research process</li>
						<li>Improve public understanding and support for psychological research</li>
						<li>Support the research goals of the School of Psychology</li></ol>
				</p>  
<hr>
			<h2>Educational value of research participation</h2>
				<p>In today's competitive job market, possessing strong research skills distinguishes university graduates. By actively participating in research, students acquire knowledge, comprehension, and values that form the foundation of these skills. This experience aims to contribute to fulfilling the undergraduate learning outcomes of the psychology program, encompassing a broad and in-depth understanding of the discipline and proficiency in research methods.</p>  
	      
			<h2 id="current">How to take part as a current student</h2>
				<h3>Earning course credits</h3>
					<p>At Level C and I undergraduate students are required to collect 25 course credits by actively participating in psychological research.  All research is scrutinised by the Ethics Committee prior to being advertised on the School of Psychology participant pool. Risk will have been assessed and mitigated for. Each credit is worth 15 minutes of your time, which equates to around six and a half hours particpation over each academic year.  Some studies will be 1 or 2 credits, and some will be worth a lot more as they will require much longer participation durations, or participating over a number of days/weeks</p>
					<p>Your contact for any enquiries from students in Level C is Dr Jamie Lingwood (lingwoj@hope.ac.uk)</p>
				<h3>Accessing available studies</h3>
					<p>The Participant Panel can be accessed via <a href="https://liverpoolhope.sona-systems.com/">https://liverpoolhope.sona-systems.com/</a> Alternatively, you can find it through the mobile app - simply search 'sona mobile' in the App store or Google Play Store.</p>
					<p>You will be asked for a URL, which is the same as the above, and will be emailed your password so that you can log in by using your University username when you sign up.</p>
					<p>If you fail to turn up to a study without informing the researcher, you will incur a penalty equal to the number of credits of the study. If the study is worth 3 credits for example, you will lose 3 credits. It is important that you turn up to studies or cancel 24 hours in advance.
					<p>Students with 5 no shows will be contacted by their tutor.</p>

			<h2 id="public">How to take part as a member of the public</h2>
				<p>The School maintains a public Participant Panel to assist with various research projects. It is comprised of members of the general public who are interested in taking part in psychological research and agreed to be contacted about future studies. If you are interested in joining the panel (and you are at least 18 years old), please read through the information below and <a href="https://liverpoolhope.fra1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5sZP4xNnVms5muy">sign up online</a>.</p><p>As researchers we hold ourselves up to the highest ethical standards and as such we adhere to the ethical guidelines of <a href="https://www.hope.ac.uk/research/researchethics/">Liverpool Hope University</a> and <a href="https://www.bps.org.uk/guidelines-and-documents">The British Psychological Society</a>.  Our researchers employ various methodologies to investigate the intricate workings of the brain and mind, including how we perceive, remember, learn, and interact with others. Some studies are conducted online, allowing you to participate from home, while others require visiting the University to complete tasks or join a focus group to share your thoughts and experiences. Participants are typically compensated for their time. When invited to participate, you will receive detailed information about the study, including its duration and requirements. Participation is entirely voluntary, and choosing not to take part will not affect your membership in the Participant Panel.</p>
				<p>The Participant Panel adheres to strict Data Protection guidelines. All researchers who access the Participant Panel complete Data Protection Awareness training. When a researcher from the School of Psychology requires participants for a study, they must first obtain ethical approval before contacting panel members and requesting relevant participant information according to their project's needs. Data is managed in compliance with General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), kept securely, and only shared with those directly involved in the research. You can request to have your details removed from the Panel at any time by emailing Dr Glen Pennington using the email address penning@hope.ac.uk.</p>
			<h3>Types of studies</h3>
				<p>
				<ol>
				<li><strong>Online questionnaires:</strong> Researchers conduct a wide range of studies which can be accessed via links on any device</li>
				<li><strong>Online experiments:</strong> We also run some experimental research studies online. No specialist software is necessary, but these studies typically run on Windows/Mac and not on tablets or smart phones</li>
				<li><strong>Face-to-Face Research:</strong> Studies also take place in person in our lab facilities, located in Hope Park Campus, Liverpool</li></ol></p></p>
